page.overview.text=OVERVIEW\n\nTuring machines are abstract mathematical devices. They consist of an infinite tape, with each cell of the tape containing one symbol. The Turing machine writes on this tape. The usability of Turing machines is that it includes conditionality when to write a symbol, as well as the option to move the tape left and right. This behaviour enables it to perform any existing algorithm, no matter how complex that algorithm is.\n\nVisual Turing is a visual implementation of this abstract machine, and tries to simulate an infinite tape. Besides the basic functionality, Visual Turing adds some other functionality to ease the development of Turing machines.
page.drawing.text=DRAWING TURING MACHINES\n\nWhen you start Visual Turing, an editor window will be already displayed. You can open new editor windows, and you can even copy-paste between windows. Each window is made out of 4 parts:\n - the component tree, which contains the symbols, instructions and machines that you can add to the drawing panel\n - the drawing panel, where you draw and connect the instructions\n - the tape, where the machine will write the symbols\n - the toolbar, containing buttons such as New Window, Open Workspace, Draw Instruction, Run Machine etc.\n\nTHE COMPONENT TREE\nThe component tree contains all the symbols, instructions and machines that you can add to your drawing panel. At start only two symbols are defined: # and a. The # symbol is used as the 'empty' symbol, and it cannot be deleted. Visual Turing supports Turing machines that have a symbol set containing more than just 2 symbols. To define a new symbol, you can right-click on the 'Symbols' tree node (or press Ctrl+Alt+S) and a dialog will show up, where you can select what new symbol you want to add. Similarly, you can remove symbols from the set by right-clicking on them and clicking on 'Delete'.\nThere are three Instructions defined: left, right and 'do nothing'. The left and right move the cursor on the tape, while 'do nothing' does exactly what its name says. This instruction was added to solve some common problems when designing Turing machines. For example, your first action will depend whether the starting symbol is 'a' or '#'. If there wasn't a 'do nothing' instruction, then you'd have to use the Left, then the Right instruction, and only then could you check the symbol.\nA tree does not contain any Turing machines on default. If you've created machines earlier, you can IMPORT them by right-clicking on the 'Machines' node (or press Ctrl+I). Once a Machine has been imported, you can add it to the editor panel just like any other instruction or symbol.\n\nTHE EDITOR PANEL\nYou draw your Turing machine here. Drawing is done by simple drag-and-drop. You add two instructions to the panel, then you click on the Connection button, and drag a line from one instruction to another. The two instructions are now connected. You can set the connection's condition by right-clicking on the connection and clicking on 'Condition'. If you set, for example, that the condition is 'a', then the 2nd instruction will only get executed if the current symbol on the tape is 'a'. You can also set that the condition is the negation of the selected condition, by checking 'NOT' in the Condition dialog.\nYou can delete components by right-clicking on them and clicking on 'Delete', or by using the Eraser tool. With the Eraser you just drag the mouse on the drawing panel and it will delete everything in its path.\n\nTHE TAPE\nVisual Turing simulates an infinite tape, which means that it will contain as many symbols as much memory you have. In practice, this should be more than enough :)\nYou can click on the tape, and by using the left and right buttons on your keyboard you can change the current position of the cursor. You can also type symbols on the tape (but only symbols that were defined!)\n\n  
page.executing.text=EXECUTING YOUR TURING MACHINE\n\nOnce you've drawn your Turing machine, you can start it running by clicking on the Run button (green triangle) in the toolbar. The machine will run at the default speed of 100 instructions per second. If you want to change this speed, press F7 and a dialog will show up where you can adjust the execution speed.\nExecution can be paused or stopped. You can also use the Step button to execute the machine manually, step-by-step.
page.exporting.text=EXPORTING TURING MACHINES\n\nTuring machines can be used as part of another Turing machine, i.e. they're modular. The purpose of this program is to enable you to build very complex machines as easily as possible. For example, a machine which calculates the sum of two numbers is made out of hundreds of instructions. When nicely packed into machines, it can be made out of only 10-20 components.\n\nTo export a machine, you need to have at least one (starting) instruction or machine on your drawing panel. Right-click on the drawing panel and click on 'Export' (or press Ctrl+E). A file dialog will show up and you can select where you want to save your machine. \nThat's it! Now you can import your machine and use it as a component of a greater machine.
page.special.text=SPECIAL FEATURES\n\nVisual Turing includes some special features which are not strictly correct in theory, but will make your life easier. Let's say you want to make a achine which moves 5 cells to the right. You would normally draw 5 Right instructions and connect them. You can save time by simply drawing 1 Right instruction and set how many times should it get repeated. Right-click on the instruction (or machine) and click on 'Set N'. A dialog will show up where you have to enter a number greater than 1. For example, enter 5, and your instruction will get executed 5 times. You can also enter an expression, like n+5. The n number is indicated by a small number on the right side of the instruction.\nYou may want to create a machine that executes actions several times, but you don't want to define exactly how many times. For example, you want to create a Right machine, but you want to be asked each time how many cells should it go to the right. In this case, open the Set N dialog, and instead of typing in a number, type in 'n'. This means the machine is using an undefined variable. When you execute your machine, you will get asked about the value of n.\nTo use an 'n-machine', export your machine. When you later import these machines and you want to use them, you will get asked about the value of n.
